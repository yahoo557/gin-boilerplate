### ðŸš€ **Why Golang?**
âœ… **Performance & Efficiency** â€“ Golang's compiled nature and lightweight goroutines make it highly performant and efficient for building scalable applications.  
âœ… **Simplicity & Readability** â€“ The language's minimalist syntax promotes code readability and maintainability, reducing complexity.  
âœ… **Concurrency Support** â€“ Goroutines and channels enable efficient concurrent processing, making it ideal for high-performance, distributed systems.  
âœ… **Strong Standard Library** â€“ Built-in support for networking, HTTP, cryptography, and more, reducing the need for external dependencies.  
âœ… **Cross-Platform Compilation** â€“ Go binaries can be compiled for different architectures without additional dependencies, making deployment easier.  
âœ… **Robust Ecosystem** â€“ A strong ecosystem with tools like `Go Modules`, `gRPC`, `Gin`, `Gorm`, and `Confluent Kafka` supports modern backend development.  
âœ… **Cloud-Native Ready** â€“ Optimized for microservices, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and cloud-native applications.

ðŸ”¹ **TL;DR**: Golang is an efficient, scalable, and cloud-native programming language that excels in building modern, high-performance applications. ðŸš€

### ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Structure?**
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Easily extendable for more domains, transport layers, and infrastructure components.  
âœ… **Testability** â€“ Clean separation allows easier unit testing.  
âœ… **Flexibility** â€“ Supports multiple data sources (SQL, NoSQL), messaging (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and API formats (REST, gRPC).  
âœ… **DDD + Clean Architecture** â€“ Combines the best of both worlds without overcomplicating dependencies.
